                <p>Tesla had been working at the Machine Works for a total of six months when he quit. In March 1885 he met with patent attorney Lemuel W. Serrell and two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who agreed to finance an arc lighting manufacturing and utility company in Tesla's name, the Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.</p>

After the utility was up and running. They formed a new utility company, abandoning Tesla's company and leaving the inventor penniless. Tesla even lost control of the patents he had generated, since he had assigned them to the company in exchange for stock.</p>

                <p>In late 1886, Tesla met Alfred S. Brown, a Western Union superintendent, and New York attorney Charles F. Peck. Together they formed the Tesla Electric Company in April. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty Street in Manhattan, where he worked on improving and developing new types of electric motors, generators, and other devices. That year Tesla developed an induction motor that ran on alternating current.</p>

                <p class="text-right">The money Tesla made from licensing his AC patents made him independently wealthy and gave him the time and funds to pursue his own interests. Tesla moved out of the Liberty Street shop and for the next dozen years would work out of a series of workshop/laboratory spaces in Manhattan. Tesla and his hired staff would conduct some of his most significant work in these workshops.</p>

                <p>In the early morning hours of March 13, 1895 the South Fifth Avenue building that housed Tesla's lab caught fire. It started in the basement of the building and was so intense Tesla's 4th floor lab burned and collapsed into the second floor. The fire not only set back Tesla's ongoing projects, it destroyed a collection of early notes and research material, models, and demonstration pieces, including many that had been exhibited at the 1893 Worlds Colombian Exposition.</p>

                <p>To further study the conductive nature of low pressure air Tesla set up an experimental station at high altitude in Colorado Springs during 1899. There he conducted experiments with a large coil operating in the megavolts range, producing artificial lightning (and thunder) consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet (41 m) long discharges.</p>

                <p class="text-right">In March, 1901 Tesla began planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility to be built in Shoreham, New York. By July 1901 Tesla had expanded his plans to build a more powerful transmitter to leap ahead of Marconi's radio based system, which Tesla thought was a copy of his system. In December 1901 Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to Newfoundland, defeating Tesla in the race to be first to complete such a transmission.</p>

                <p>Investors on Wall Street were putting their money into Marconi's system and some in the press began turning against Tesla's project, claiming it was a hoax. The project came to a halt in 1905. Tesla mortgaged the Wardenclyffe property to cover his debts at the Waldorf-Astoria, which eventually mounted to $20,000 ($478,200 in today's dollars). He lost the property in foreclosure in 1915 and in 1917 the Tower was demolished by the new owner to make the land a more viable real estate asset.</p>

Tesla worked with several companies including the period 1919–1922 working in Milwaukee for Allis-Chalmers. He spent most of his time trying to perfect the Tesla turbine with Hans Dahlstrand, the head engineer at the company but engineering difficulties meant it was never made into a practical device. Tesla did license the idea to a precision instrument company and it found use in the form of luxury car speedometers and other instruments.</p>

                <p>In 1931, Kenneth Swezey, a young writer who had been associated with Tesla for some time, organized a celebration for the inventor's 75th birthday. Tesla received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein, and he was also featured on the cover of Time magazine. The party went so well Tesla made it an annual event, an occasion where he would put out a large spread of food and drink (featuring dishes of his own creation) and invite the press to see his inventions, hear a stories about past exploits, views on current events, or sometimes odd or baffling claims.</p>

Assistant medical examiner H.W. Wembly examined the body and ruled that the cause of death had been coronary thrombosis.</p>
